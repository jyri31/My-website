<h1>About Jyri Mattila</h1>
<p>I am a quantitative finance enthusiast with a strong academic and professional background in financial mathematics and 
  quantitative risk management. I hold a MSc in financial mathematics from LSE, where I studied wide range of theoretical 
  and computational courses from topics including stochastic processes, machine learning, probability theory, and fixed income. 
  Right after the degree, I was offered a full-time position as a quant at Nordea.</p>

<p>My job experiences range from university-level teaching to managerial roles. The position as a head of part-time teachers at 
  Aalto University has been one of my most valuable experiences. I taught various courses in pure and applied mathematics, which 
  taught me to communicate my ideas intuitively. Years of teaching gave me a surprisingly deep understanding in the topics, which 
  also earned me a place in one of the best universities in the world. After a while, I gained distinction for my work and I was 
  trusted the responsibility of recruiting and training new teachers.</p>

<p>In addition, I am interested in bespoke clothing. I just finished my first bespoke project with Kent & Haste. Documentation of 
  the project is coming up on this page.</p>
